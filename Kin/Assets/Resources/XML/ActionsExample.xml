    Multiple Action Wrapper

      they will all occur at once, instead of sequentially as normal. The
      cutscene will move on when all actions within a MultiAction wrapper have
      completed. A Wait action is a good way of ensuring that this wrapper has
      a lower bound on the time it can take.
