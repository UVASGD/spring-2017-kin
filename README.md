##Controls

Arrow = Movement

X = Attack

Circle = Roll

Square = Interact

Triangle = Use

Start/Middle = Pause

R1/L1 = switch through consumables


Level Up Change Idea

Will only show progress, summary of stat, where to go

Leveling up the mechanism requires going to the monastery

For balancing there will be different levels (i.e. overall level)
