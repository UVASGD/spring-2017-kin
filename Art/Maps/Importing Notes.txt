Steps to importing the maps into Unity
1. Export Map as layers (ground, wall, trees, objects)
2. Import each layer as spritesheet into Aesprite, with grid size 2000x2000
3. Export each layer as a sequence of png's
4. Rename grid segments from numbers to grid location (A1, B1, A2, ...)
5. Import grid segments into Unity, changing the interpolation to "point"
	- is this possible to do via code?
6. Place grid segments into Scene givien a start location (0, 0, 0)
	- each layer should have its segments under a single gameobject
7. Set the layering property of each segment properly
