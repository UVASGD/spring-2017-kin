AGENDA 9_17

1. Make sure everyone understands how to clone, branch, commit, and merge (oops)
2. Make sure Programmers get comfortable with Unity (Jackson will help with this)
	-but also see the Tutorial links in the Resources folder of the repo.
3. Slack
4. Split into teams and get cracking :)

AI - something tangible and start creating the base classes
Systems - figure out and implement hitboxes, and do combat
UI - intro to UI, create sliders for health and stamina (pending art), and begin work on the main menu scene (Resume, New, Load, and Credits)
Design - finish planning out the world and with the aid of controllers, pick a good feeling controller scheme
Art - create basic avatar movement sprites and, hopefully attack sprites
Music -  get everyone on the same page regarding sounds, to make sure everyone has gone over the asset list, and to divide those between each person.
