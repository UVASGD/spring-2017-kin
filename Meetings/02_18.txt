Alright, well this is the second time I'm writing this because emacs crashed?

First things first:
1) MSE is in 5 weeks and we're likely to miss a meeting to Spring Break!
2) Any new members we missed last time? #memes&&dreams
3) Jared and Laura!

Okay, let's break out into our teams (Aethetics will meet later but some of them might be here)

WORLD_BUILDING:
1) let's get experience accumulating on kills and saving/loading
2) let's get some prototype traps working today
   a) walk over them and they trigger
   b) some sort of visual effect (particles?)
   c) disappear on death
3) Do days properly increment on a change of day? (DayNightController and TimeController)

AETHETICS:
1) has everyone picks some stuff they'd like to work on over the next week?
2) and stuff to share from last week?
3) let's take a look at the assets sheet
4) Brian, how're those dank jams?

BOSSES:
