Game Feel and "Features":
1) player should only collide w/ friendlies & bosses
2) Boss recoil should not be a thing
	- going into Recoil animation can sometimes break Ixtab's attacks, allowing the player to avoid 
		taking ANY damage
3) Ixtab can be forced into only spawning skull candy if the player is directly above her
4) Ixtab spawns boios too rarely
	- spawn more than just Kamis
	- spawned boios need larger agro range
*5) rolling and attacking only counts for one action on stamina
6) Skullcandy should maybe revolve around Ixtab as well as speed away from
	- perhaps increase the speed of both params as battle progresses
7) when Ixtab is invisible she should not follow the player, but wander the arena
	- Ixtab comes out of invisibility too quickly; maybe wait until all spawned boios have been killed
		before coming back?
*7) Might not be the cause, but pressing "E" a bunch while exploring possibly leads to crashes
****9) DON"T SPAM THAT FUCKING BELL
10) Crossfade between music tracks?
11) World is too empty. Why do I have to keep killing bombs and naked wizards?
	- MOAR VARIATION
*12) things don't die when they are killed
13) yes i would like to go up and down on sideways stairs
14) Camera should briefly focus  on bosses to introduce them
	- if artist(s) aren't already overencumbered, make them draw a cool intro animation
15) game should pause when in options menu
