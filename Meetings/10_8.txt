MSE is on November 5th, less than a month away
We have Aseprite (art already knows) but it's open to ere'body
Break into teams--

UI - main menu, start stat canvas!
Systems - Hitboxes, combat, combo -this needs to get finished, Jackson will work with you all.
AI - meet again with Design as necessary, flesh out minions, start implementing the beginnings of a boss if time permits
Design - Talk out combos, talk out level up system, hopefully an intro to Tiled, rediscussion of items and health
Art - main character art really needs to get done, also --as usual-- tiles, structurs, and boss stuff :)
Audio - hopefully some main track protoypes and begin finalizing combat-related sound effects.
